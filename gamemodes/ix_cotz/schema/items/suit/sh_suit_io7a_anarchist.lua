The IO7a itself is a uniform adapted from outside the zone, a tactical force uniform, sadly the tactical force itself is unknown, due to the secretive, and covered up operations. The suit is popular with mercenaries, who very often engage in firefights to maintain their quality. It's also a popular choice with bandits, as the cheap price allows the common bandit to supply their rather cheap setup. The suit is the best low-class for good ballistic protection."
