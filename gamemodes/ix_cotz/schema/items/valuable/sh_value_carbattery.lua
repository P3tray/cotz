Automotive batteries like this one are designed to deliver maximum current for a short period of time. They are sometimes referred to as \"SLI batteries\" for this reason, for starting, lighting, and ignition. SLI batteries are not designed for deep discharging, and a full discharge can reduce the battery's lifespan. Despite this, they're often used in the zone for powering lights and other appliances."
