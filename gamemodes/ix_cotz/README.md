# S.T.A.L.K.E.R Automated Gamemode Schema

The idea behind this schema is to provide a base schema that would allow one to set up a completely hands-off automated gamemode.
The gamemode tries as much as possible to avoid having a reliance on admins outside of the setup phase of the server.
The theme we've chosen as a backdrop for this gamemode is the STALKER games.
