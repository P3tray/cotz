Its lever-action design was chosen at the behest of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, best known at the time as manufacturers of lever-action rifles such as the Winchester Model 1873. Designer John Browning suggested that a pump-action would be much more appropriate for a repeating shotgun, but Winchester management's position was that, at the time, the company was known as a 'lever-action firearm company', and felt that their new shotgun must also be a lever-action for reasons of brand recognition.\n\nAmmo: 12 Gauge \nMagazine Capacity: 6"
