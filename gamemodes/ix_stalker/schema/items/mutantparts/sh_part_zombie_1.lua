ITEM.longdesc = "This is a partly decomposed hand from a zombie - former human beings who lived or worked in the Exclusion Zone and were subjected to extreme amounts of radiation and psy-influence when the second Chernobyl incident occurred. After many years of being in this state, they possess only a seemingly frail body with bones and half-rotten flesh clearly visible. For this reason, the creatures very much resemble re-animated dead bodies, however they are very much alive and almost permanently hungry and thus can become a threat when encountered in packs. Severed hands not only constitutes a scientific research material but in many cases can also be used to identify the person to whom the hand belonged."
