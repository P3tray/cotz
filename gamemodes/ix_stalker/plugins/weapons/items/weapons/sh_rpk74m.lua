ITEM.description = "The RPK-74 was introduced in 1974 together with the AK-74 assault rifle and chambered for the new 5.45Ã—39mm intermediate cartridge. It was derived from the AK-74 rifle, with modifications that mirror those made to the AKM to create the RPK. It also uses a longer and heavier chrome-plated barrel, bipod, adjusted gas channel in the gas block, and a different front sight tower."
