Very common in the Zone and unofficially used outside the Zone for treating people who have been exposed to hazardous or deadly chemical and toxic agents. This artifact is quite heavy as the gravitational field seems to increase mass. It will slightly protect its user against extreme heat and acids produced respectively by fire and chemical anomalies.
